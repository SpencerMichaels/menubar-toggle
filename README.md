# menubar-toggle (OS X 10.11+)
Toggle OS X El Capitan's menu bar auto-hide state from the command line.

Install with:
```
brew tap sxmichaels/tap
brew install menubar-toggle
```

Note that `menubar-toggle` only works on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and
newer, since the auto-hide functionality does not exist on previous
versions of OS X.

# Credits
The original Objective-C version of `menubar-toggle`, from which the
current Swift one derives, was based in large part on Sindre Sorhus's
[dark-mode](https://github.com/sindresorhus/dark-mode).
